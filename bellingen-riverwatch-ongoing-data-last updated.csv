 Did not do an oxygen probe testing at this site.
 Regarding the available Phosphate figure of 0.06 : I have been worried about the reproducibility and reliability of my phosphate meter so borrowed Amy’s meter to compare.
 I did triplicate readings on mine (0.03, 0.06, 0.05) then triplicate on Amy’s (0.10, 0.06, 0.05)
 I uploaded the average of all 6 readings to get 0.06.
 I am not convinced that these meters are accurate enough, especially at the very low levels of phosphate that we are usually reading.
